Secured the runners up position for creating a project to help navigate visually impaired people

## Idea

With this, we aim to help visually impaired people become independent. It can detect obstacles in the personâ€™s way and hence guide them accordingly. 
We use audio cues to guide the person to the correct or obstacle free path. 

## Implementation

We used Single Shot Detector (SSD) object detection which provides a good balance between speed and accuracy since the project would work on real-time implementation. The COCO dataset is used for the objects.
